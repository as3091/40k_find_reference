#### Idea
A tool to find what the references are for a given text in Warhammer 40k universe.

Example: 

_There shall come to pass days of great darkness, when mankind is diminished and all the lights of the world shall be extinguished, and the final scraps of hope torn away. I dreamed I was upon a plain of black sand studded with diamond stars. In the dream there was a great hunger that pervaded all time and space, a more terrible and consuming appetite than the thirst that dogs my sons. It rose from the east of the night, and swallowed the moons of Baal that coursed across the unfamiliar sky. Before Baal Secundus was consumed, a bright light flashed upon it and sped away, outpacing the shadows._  
_--From the novel "Dante" by Guy Haley_

This obviously references the battle of tyranids vs Blood angels that happens in the Devastation of Baal series by Guy Haley


#### This is still WIP so don't expect it to work perfectly.
_obviously i will not be uploading any Games Workshop copyrighted books here_
